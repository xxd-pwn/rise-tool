# RISE

RISE is an automated rule-driven SQL dialect translation tool that utilizes dialect-aware query reduction.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Replace the parameters in *llm.py* and *db.py* based on your environment.
- Set up the databases for TPC-DS and SQLProBench on the latest PostgreSQL, consulting the schema files in TPC-DS and SQLProBench for detailed commands.

### Required Libraries

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare ANTLR Parser
You need to build the parser using the ANTLR4 tool in /utils/antlr:
```bash
java -jar antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 PostgreSQLLexer.g4 PostgreSQLParser.g4
```
Please note that there are some syntax errors (mainly due to the misuse of 'this') in the Python files generated by ANTLR. Correct them before running.

## Running the Project

Query translation must be performed manually, one rule at a time. Automated validation of rule correctness is not feasible—incorrect rules can corrupt the entire rule repository. Always review and verify each translated rule before manually adding it to the rule library.
